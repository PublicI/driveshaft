You can try out our [demo deploy](https://gentle-caverns-1193.herokuapp.com/index) of Driveshaft on Heroku.

<h2 id="index-page">Index Page</h2>

The **index page** of Driveshaft contains two main components.  At the top of the page, users can manually enter the URL or ID of a Google Document they'd like to convert to JSON.  If they supply an optional S3 destination, they will be able to publish the JSON as well as view it on the subsequent **file page.**
