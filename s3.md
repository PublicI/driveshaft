Now that you can access your files and convert them into JSON, the next step is to publish them to S3.

To start, you'll need to have or sign up for an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.

<h2 id="setup">Setting Up S3</h2>

### Create an S3 bucket

Log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), and go to the [S3 home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home). (S3 stands for for Simple Storage Service. You can think of it as a filesystem in the cloud.)

Click on **Create Bucket**.

This bucket needs to have a globally unique name. It's common to name buckets after a domain name you control, for example, `assets.nytimes.com`.

### Create an IAM user for Driveshaft

Go to the [IAM > Users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users) section of the console. (IAM is short for "Identity and Access Management"â€”essentially it's a user account for your app).

Click on **Create New Users**.

![Click on Create New Users]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_02.png)

Give your Driveshaft user a name, and click **Create**. Then search for and click on your new account on the Users page.

![Enter a user id]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_03.png)

Click on **Manage Access Keys**, and then **Create Access Key**.

![Click on Manage Access Keys]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_05.png)

Download the credentials JSON and store in a safe place.

![Note your IAM credentials]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_06.png)

Note the two keys: an access key and a secret access key. Enter them in the following environmental variables:

``` bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="*********"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="*********"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1" # or another region
```

### Authorize the user to access your S3 bucket

Click on the **Create User Policy** button.

![Click on Create User Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_04.png)

A user policy says which S3 buckets and API actions the user is allowed to access. This policy should allow access to the new bucket you created.

The syntax for these rules (or "policies") is a bit... [esoteric](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html). So we have a sample policy here that you can enter in the **Custom Policy** section that gives access to a single S3 bucket.

``` json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Put*",
        "s3:List*",
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:Delete*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::assets.nytimes.com/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::assets.nytimes.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Just replace `assets.nytimes.com` with the name of your bucket.

## Check that it works

Driveshaft should now be able to publish to your S3 bucket. Try it out with with the following spreadsheet.

Enter the following into the form on the [main page](http://localhost:9292/index), (again replacing `assets.nytimes.com` with your bucket) and hit **Submit**:

* **key**: `16NZKPy_kyWb_c0jBLo_sTvyoGUrs-ISG7uMDHBMgM5U`
* **destination**: `s3://assets.nytimes.com/spreadsheet.json`

![Enter an S3 destination]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_07.png)

Next, click on the red **Publish to...** button.

![Enter an S3 destination]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_08.png)

If it works, you'll see a log of the first published version when the page reloads.

![Enter an S3 destination]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_09.png)

Click on any **Restore** button to revert to a previous version of the json.

On S3, the canonical or latest version of a file is stored at the destination you specify (like `s3://assets.nytimes.com/spreadsheet.json`). But a second timestamped file is kept for every version:

`s3://assets.nytimes.com/spreadsheet-20150515-120000.json`

When you **publish** a file, the canonical version is updated, and a new timestamped version is created. When you **restore** a version, the canonical version is replaced with the version you specify.
