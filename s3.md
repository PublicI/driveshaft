Now that you can access your files and convert them into JSON, the next step is to publish them to S3.

To start, you'll need to have or sign up for an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.

<h2 id="setup">Setting Up S3</h2>

### Create or select an S3 bucket.

Log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), go to the [S3 home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home). (S3 stands for for Simple Storage Service. You can think of it as a filesystem in the cloud).

Create an **S3 Bucket** by clicking on **Create Bucket**. This bucket needs to have a globally unique name. It's common to name buckets after a domain name you control, for example, `assets.nytimes.com`.

### Create an IAM user for Driveshaft

Go to the [IAM > Users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users) section of the console (short for "Identity and Access Management"). Click on **Create New Users**.

![Click on Create New Users]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_02.png)

Give your Driveshaft user a name, and click **Create**. Then click on your new account name on the Users page.

Click on **Manage Access Keys**, and then **Create Access Key**.

![Click on Manage Access Keys]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_05.png)

You will be presented with two variables: an access key and a secret access key. Store these in a safe place.

![Note your IAM credentials]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_06.png)

Enter these in the following environmental variables:

``` bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="*********"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="*********"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1" # or another region
```

### Authorize the user to access your S3 bucket

![Enter a user id]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_03.png)

Click on the **Create User Policy** button.

![Click on Create User Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_04.png)

This will let you give this user specific S3 buckets and API actions it is allowed to access. This is essential for protecting the rest of your AWS account, should your credentials ever be compromised.

The syntax for these rules (or "policies") is [extremely esoteric](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html). So we have an sample policy here that you can enter in the **Custom Policy** section that gives access to a single S3 bucket.

``` json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Put*",
        "s3:List*",
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:Delete*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::assets.nytimes.com/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::assets.nytimes.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

You should now be able to publish to your S3 bucket from Driveshaft. Try publishing this publish spreadsheet to a destination on your S3 bucket. Enter the following into the form on the [main page](http://localhost:9292/index) and hit **Submit**:

* **key**: `16NZKPy_kyWb_c0jBLo_sTvyoGUrs-ISG7uMDHBMgM5U`
* **destination**: `s3://assets.nytimes.com/spreadsheet.json`

![Enter an S3 destination]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_07.png)

Next, click on **Publish to assets.nytimes.com** (but with the name of your bucket).

![Enter an S3 destination]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_08.png)

If the publish is successful, you'll see a log of the published versions below.

![Enter an S3 destination]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/s3_09.png)

You can use the **Restore** button next to any previous timestamp to revert to that version of the json.

On S3, the canonical or latest version of a file is stored at the destination you specify (like `s3://assets.nytimes.com/spreadsheet.json`). But a second timestamped file is kept for every version, for example:

`s3://assets.nytimes.com/spreadsheet-20150515-120000.json`

When you **publish** a file, the canonical version is updated, and a new timestamped version is created. When you **restore** a version, the canonical version is replaced with the version you specify.
